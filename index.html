        <p>
          In the fifth and final week of the design course at Epicodus, students were grouped together and challenged to complete an assignment. This assignment was to create an application that would serve as a tool for colonizing Mars. Our group of designers: Amber, J’ena, Rachael, and Larry decided they would be interested in creating an application for a bio scanner named Bio-Matic. This scanner would be used to detect dangerous levels of radiation and track other important vital information. Our group decided the application would be mobile only due to limitations in functionality with a desktop design. We also decided a bright, yet comforting, retro-futuristic color scheme would be best to convey a relaxed feeling to a possibly injured user. The app was to have three main functions: bio scanning, generating user profiles, and tracking vital information. Together we decided the best course of action was to split up into smaller groups, and tackle these challenges. Unfortunately, this application was never implemented by SpaceX.

          Our group needed to create an application that would successfully scan and track a user’s vital information such as radiation exposure, blood oxygen level, bone density and blood vitamin/mineral concentration. The design needed to be user friendly and easy to navigate for potentially injured users.

          Examining atomic age posters created by NASA, our group decided a retro-futuristic design would be aesthetically pleasing, and fit well, with the space travel nature of the project.

        We generated fake user personas to better understand the needs of potential users.

          After conducting interviews and coming up with ideas independently, our group exchanged ideas with each other. This gave us a cohesive idea on the direction the project should take.
